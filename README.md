1. What is Git ?
Ans : Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files,
usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.
Git's goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

2. What do you understand by the term ‘Version Control System’?
Ans : Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
 Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

3. What is GitHub ?
Ans : GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code.
It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking,
software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

4. Mention some popular Git hosting services ?
Ans : Github
      Bitbucket
      Gitlab
      SourceForge
      Codebase
      Gitea
   
5. Different types of version control systems.
Ans : The types of VCS are:
Local Version Control System.
Centralized Version Control System.
Distributed Version Control System.

6. What benefits come with using GIT ?
Ans : One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems,
 Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.
 Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.

7. What is a Git repository ?
Ans : A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories.
 It is a crucial component of the Git version control system, which enables collaborative development and allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

8. How can you initialize a repository in Git ?
Ans : Initializing a new repository: git init
To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo.
 Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory.
